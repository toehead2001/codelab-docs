# Overview

CodeLab lets you write code that is compiled on the fly, and that is then immediately executed in the Paint.NET effect engine. With this you can implement almost any type of effect you want, if you have the programming and mathematical talent to do so. This plugin works by presenting you with a code editor that you can use to type in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/) code that is then compiled and executed (rendered) as soon as you stop typing.
