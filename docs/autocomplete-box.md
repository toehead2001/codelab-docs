## Filtering

### String Filtering

As you continue to type while the AutoComplete Box is open, the list of items will filter to only match the characters you've typed.

Note: You can also filter using Initials. ex: "isc" will match **I**nt**S**lider**C**ontrol`

### Object Filtering

If you only want to show a specific object type, you can use one of these hotkeys to invoke filtering:
