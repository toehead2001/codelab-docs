Help content can be one of these four types:

- None. If no help text is entered, no ? button will be added to your effect.

- Plain text (including tabs and returns). This will be displayed in a modal message box.

- URL. If your help text is a URL, it will be opened in a non-modal browser window.

- Rich Formatted Text. This will be displayed in a modal pop up form with a rich text format control. All RTF features are supported including pictures. All URLs included are automatically clickable and open in a new browser window.
